# Image Averaging Scripts                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                        This directory contains scripts for installing necessary Python packages and calculating the pixel-wise average of images in a directory.                                      
                                                                                                                                                                     
  **Scripts:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  1. **install_packages.py:** This script installs the required Python packages Pillow and numpy. Run this before running image_average.py. This needs to be run with            
  appropriate permissions for package installation.                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  2. **image_average.py:** This script calculates the pixel-wise average of all images in the `~/Desktop/Screenshots` directory and saves the result as `averaged_image.png` in  
  the same directory.                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  **How to Run:**                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  1. Run `python install_packages.py` to install necessary Python packages.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  2. Run `python image_average.py` to calculate the average image.                                                                                                               
  3. The resulting image will be saved as `averaged_image.png` in the `~/Desktop/Screenshots` directory.
